INT = integral
SIG = sigma

(EX)
E[X] = M(sub x) w/ arrows to discrete and continuous
discrete: SIG x*P(X=x)
continous: INT from -INF to INF x*f(x) dx

Suppose we have a random variable X, where X = # of heads from flipping a fair coin 3 times
SIG = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT}
P{H and H and H} = P(H) * P(H) * P(H)
X       0     1     2     3
P(X=x)  1/8   3/8   3/8   1/8

E[X] = 0*(1/8) + 1*(3/8) + 2*(3/8) + 3*(1/8) = 0 + (3+6+3)/8 = 12/8 = 3/2 = 1.5

(EX)
V[X] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 ### E[X^2] != E[X]^2
E[X^2] = INT from -INF to INF of x^2 * f(x) dx = SIG x^2 * P(X=x)
V[X] = O^2(sub x) = O^2 w/ arrows to discrete and continuous
  = [0 - 3/2]^2 * 1/8 + [1 - 3/2]^2 * 3/8 + [2 - 3/2]^2 * 3/8 + [3 - 3/2]^2 * 1/8
  = 9/32 + 3/32 + 3/32 + 9/32 = 24/32 = 3/4
  discrete: SIG from i=1 (x - Mu(sub x))^2 * P(X=x) ### Mu(sub x) = E[X]
  continuous: INT from -INF to INF
  
(EX)
Let X = time Reid waits for the 9:00am AppalCart
X~Unif[0,20]
f(x) = 1/20; 0<=x<=20
INT from 0 to 20 of 1/20 dx = x/20 |0to20 = 20/20 - 0/20 = 1 - 0 = 1
E[X] = INT from 0to20 of x * 1/20 dx = INT from 0to20 x/20 dx = x^2/40 |0to20 = 20^2/40 - 0/40 = 10
O^2(sub x) = INT from -INF to INF of (x - Mu(sub x))^2 * f(x) dx = INT from 0to20 of (x - 10)^2 * 1/20 dx
  = INT from 0to20 of (x^2 - 20x + 100)/20 dx = INT from 0to20 of (X^2/20 - x + 5)dx
  = (x^3/60 - x^2/2 + 5x) |0to20 = (20^3/60 - 20^2/2 + 5*20) - (0) = 33.333... mins^2
  so O^2(sub x) = 33.333... mins^2 which is (20^2/12)
O(sub x) = 5.77 mins

(EX)
Let X and Y be random variables. Then E[X +- Y] = E[X] +- E[Y]
If X and Y are independent, V[X +- Y] = V[X] + V[Y]
Suppose we have constants a and b, we random variables X and Y.
E[aX +- bY] = a*E[X] +- bE[Y]
If X and Y are independent V[aX +- bY] = a^2*V[X] + b^2V[Y]
